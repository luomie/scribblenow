Often at work I am opening a simple text editor window to save just temporary information fast. 
Then one day I saw [jotter.space](https://jotter.space) from [Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.co.uk/) and thought to myself why shouldn't I build something in the browser aswell? 

That's why I built scribblenow. Data is saved via a simple textfield to the local storage of the browser.
To resemble an IDE like structure I added different themes to choose from.
